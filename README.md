# Predicting-Airline-Customer-Satisfaction
This project focuses on predicting customer satisfaction in the airline industry using a dataset containing passenger information and flight experience attributes. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation
Data:

The dataset contains 9999 samples and it includes 22 features and  The target variable is Satisfaction, which categorizes passengers into three levels: Satisfaction, Neutral, or Dissatisfaction.

Methodology:

**Data exploration and cleaning**
It includes the Removal of unnecessary columns and Replacing the  null values with appropriate values

**Feature engineering**
This method incluides Feature Encoding and Feature Scaling

**Model selection and evaluation**
In this we used Decesion Tree Classifer model with different parameters and evaluated by using metrics like accuracy_score,confusion_matrix,classification_report,precision_score,recall_score

**Results:**

This model has the 
pricison_score:  93.8%
recall_score:  92.8%
Accuracy_score: 94.4%

**Dependencies:**
The necessery python libraries are 
Pandas,
Numpy,
Matplotlib.
Sciket learn was used to import and run the model, Pre proicessing and evaluation of model by using metrics.
